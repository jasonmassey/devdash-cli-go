## ID Formats
  Full UUID:    27bf66bd-945f-4714-93fd-0c3322b720f4
  Short prefix: 27bf (any unique prefix)
  Local ID:     dev-dash-42 (project-scoped)

## --since Format
  Nh          N hours (e.g., 24h)
  Nd          N days (e.g., 7d)
  Nw          N weeks (e.g., 2w)
  YYYY-MM-DD  Exact date

## Priority
  0=critical, 1=high, 2=medium (default), 3=low, 4=backlog

## Examples

  # Mark an issue as in-progress
  devdash update abc123 --status=in_progress

  # Close with summary and commit
  devdash close abc123 --summary="Added projectId to request bodies" --commit=$(git rev-parse HEAD)

  # Batch close multiple issues
  devdash close abc123 def456 --summary="Shipped both fixes"

  # Create a child issue under a parent
  devdash create --title="Fix API validation" --parent=abc123

  # Report progress (fire-and-forget, won't fail your workflow)
  devdash report abc123 --status=code_complete --summary="Tests passing"`,

	"workflow": `# DevDash Workflow Guide

## Starting Work
  devdash ready                             See what's available
  devdash show <id>                         Read the full issue
  devdash update <id> --status=in_progress  Mark as started

## Completing Work
  git add <files>
  git commit -m "message"
  git push
  devdash close <id> --summary="..." --commit=$(git rev-parse HEAD)

  Git operations MUST succeed before closing. Never close before push.

## When to Create Issues
  - Before writing ANY code (issue-first rule)
  - One issue per commit
  - When scope expands mid-task, create a new issue
  - For multi-step plans: one parent + child issues per step
  - Even spikes/investigations deserve an issue

## Decomposition Patterns
  - Parent/child: "parts of a whole" (--parent=<id>)
  - Dependencies: "X must happen before Y" (dep add)
  - Prefer parent/child for breakdown, dependencies for ordering

## Before Starting Work
  Always run devdash show <id> and check:
  - parentBeadId: understand the larger goal
  - blockedBy/blocks: understand ordering constraints
  - preInstructions: agent-specific context`,

	"close": `# Close Summary Guide

Close summaries are institutional memory. Future agents and humans will
read them to understand what happened.

## What to Include
  - What changed (files, functions, behavior)
  - Why (the motivation, not just "fixed the bug")
  - Decisions made and alternatives considered
  - Surprises or gotchas discovered
  - Follow-up work needed

## Examples

  Good: "Added cursor-based pagination to FetchAll. Chose generic approach
  with type parameter to avoid duplication. API returns plain arrays for
  some endpoints — added fallback unmarshaling."

  Bad: "Done"
  Bad: "Fixed the issue"
  Bad: "Implemented as described"

## Metadata
  --summary="..."        What changed and why
  --commit=SHA           Git commit SHA
  --pr=URL               Pull request URL (if applicable)`,

	"pr": "# Pull Request Format\n\n## DevDash Footer\nEvery PR should include a DevDash footer section:\n\n  ## DevDash\n  Project: `95ca3de0-7e4f-4f9e-9b17-36f5609cfa11`\n  Issues:\n  - [<issue-id>](https://dev-dash-blue.vercel.app/issue/<issue-id>)\n\nReplace <issue-id> with the full UUID of each devdash issue.\nIf the PR addresses multiple issues, list each on its own line.",

	"projects": `# Cross-Project Work

## Targeting a Different Project
  DD_PROJECT_ID=<full-uuid> devdash <command>

## Finding Beads Across Projects
  devdash find <full-uuid>

  Returns bead with project context (projectId, projectName).
  Requires full UUID — prefix lookup only works within a project.

## Cross-Project Dependencies
  Dependencies work across projects. The blocker bead is resolved globally
  (not project-scoped), so you can link issues from different projects.

  Use full UUIDs for cross-project bead references:
    devdash dep add <issue-uuid> <blocker-uuid-from-other-project>

  The server verifies you have access to both projects.`,

	"report": `# Progress Reporting

## Why Report
  Reporting prevents issues from appearing stale (30+ min without activity).
  It's fire-and-forget — if it fails, nothing breaks.

## Status Values
  code_complete   Code written, ready for commit
  committed       Git commit created
  pushed          Pushed to remote
  error           Something went wrong

## When to Report
  After completing code: devdash report <id> --status=code_complete --summary="..."
  After commit:          devdash report <id> --status=committed --commit=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
  After push:            devdash report <id> --status=pushed --branch=$(git branch --show-current)
  On error:              devdash report <id> --status=error --error="description"

## Always Report Before Exiting
  Even if the work is incomplete, report the current status so the issue
  doesn't appear abandoned.`,
